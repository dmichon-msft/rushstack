      "comment": "Reworked the Rush task scheduler to use a custom AsyncTaskQueue that conforms to the ECMAScript async iteration protocol. Indexed tasks by RushConfigurationProject instead of a string during task generation. Modified the TaskSelector to persist across an entire watch command invocation, instead of creating a new instance per build pass.",
